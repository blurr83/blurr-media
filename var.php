Ben&prime;s full time job is as a frontend web developer, who is passionate about CSS and html. Some call him a &ldquo;standards nut&rdquo;. Ben also loves to shoot video, for something as simple as a wedding or something as complicated as a concert.<br /><br />When Ben isn&prime;t doing any of that, he can be found either at his church lending a hand in the Audio/Visual ministry (which can be as simple as running lights or the pastors slides, to working full on production numbers) or just tinkering around the house on pet projects.";
